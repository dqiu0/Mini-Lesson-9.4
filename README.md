>## About the Project
In this project, I aim to use data collected about house information in a certain area to predict the house value. The data contains 100 properties and include 86 different features that each house has. To generate a relatively accurate prediction, I will evaluate the different combinations of characteristics and check whether their correlation is high. After, I can use the combination of those characteristics to predict house value. Normal distribution, linear regression, central limit theorem, and plotting in Python will be implemented here to demonstrate data correlation, visualize results and make predictions about possible outcomes.
